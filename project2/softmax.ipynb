    "The goal of this part of the project is to implement Softmax Regression in order to classify the MNIST digit dataset. Softmax Regression is essentially a two-layer neural network where the output layer applies the Softmax cost function, a multiclass generalization of the logistic cost function.\n",

Like the hyperbolic tangent function, the logistic function is also a sigmoid function with the characteristic 's'-like shape, though it has a range of $(0, 1)$ instead of $(-1, 1)$. Note that this is technically not a classifier since it returns probabilities instead of a predicted class, but it's easy to turn it into a classifier by simply choosing the class with the highest probability."
